    "## Overview\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:110%;\"> Itâ€™s well known that news will have significant impact on stock market since news reflect the recent the world environment and trend, which the stock market is verty sensetive to. Therefore, in our final project, we would like to look deeper into the relationship between the news and the stock market. To be more specific, we will use the headlines of news from past 5 years and the well known stock market index - DJIA and NASDQUE to see how the news headline is linked to the change in the stock market. For the news headline data source, we will do web scrapping from Reddits. For the stock market index - DJIA and NASDQUE, we will download it from Yahoo finance. Since to predict the exactly amount of the change in stock market is extremly hard, in our project, we will try to predict the movement of the stock market only. To be more specific, we will label the stock market index data with the label to indicate whether there is a rise or a drop in the stock market index. To examine the relationship between news and stock market movement, we will use text anlytics technique such as sentiment analysis, bag of words and so on to try to dig out whether news headline will affect the stock market and if yes, how will it affect the stock market. \n",

    "<p style=\"font-size:110%;\">We choose NASDAQ Composite index (NASDQUE) and Dow Johns Industrial Average (DJIA) index to be our stock index data since these two index represents two types of stock markets. For NASDAQ, it represents the general environment and condiciton of the stock in USA. For DJIA, it represents the stock market of traditional and large enterprises such as Microsoft. We hope that using these two index will give us more information about the whole stock market and also to see if news headline will have difference effects on these two indexes. \n",
